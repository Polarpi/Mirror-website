				<p class="img-story">I had wanted to learn how to bake ever since I was in third grade. My mom's friend came over to our house before we moved and made a whole bunch of desserts with us. Besides being extremely tasty, I realized cooking was very fun. In sixth grade, I secretly baked some brownies at home by myself. My parents were a little peeved at first, but after some begging and brownie bribing, they agreed to let me use the oven by myself. From there, I started baking all the time. Not everything I made turned out well, but I had lots of fun while doing it. <br><br> After baking many random things, I wanted a way to remember all the recipes I made. My solution was a food blog where I posted unaesthetic pictures and recipes of the food I made. <br><br> Also, pro tip, wear long oven mitts when taking things out of the oven, or you'll get a really bad burn on your arm like I did.</p>

				<p class="img-story">When I got to high school, I decided my cooking blog and cooking skills needed an upgrade. I started a new blog and learned how to take better pictures of my food. My blog was my secret hobby that I didn't really tell people about, but I started sharing the pictures and recipes on social media. People were very surprised at first, but now it has become a part of me, especially when I would bring treats to share at school.</p>

				<p class="img-description2">I couldn't get through high school without baking.</p>
				<p class="img-story">During high school, I learned what being stressed out was. Baking became something I would do to lose myself for an hour and not think about anything else. I remember the day before the AP Euro test, I was extremely stressed out. And so instead of studying like a good student, I made mochi and then ate it. Though I study a lot more now, I think that still accurately represents my approach towards life: do the things you love first and foremost.</p>

				<p class="img-description2">Who needs to buy cake when you can make it?</p>
				<p class="img-story">One of our family traditions is to bake a birthday cake together. In Nashville, my mom would always make a lemon cake with us for every birthday. Getting together and baking is one of my fondest memories from my childhood. With the advent of my baking by myself at home, I started to make up my own cake recipes and make a different cake for each of my family member's birthdays. We still uphold the tradition of baking a cake for each other's birthdays, except I now do most of the baking.</p>
