				<p class="img-description">First Violin Recital</p>
				<p class="img-description2">(I cried)</p>
				<p class="img-story">On my first violin recital, I was so nervous to play that I could barely walk because my legs were shaking so bad. I remember running off, crying, because I was so scared of people judging me. Though it was hard for me to come out of my shell at first, I am very grateful that I chose the violin when I was six years old. It has brought me many opportunities, friendships, and experiences that I could never have dreamed of.<br><br>The first time I held a violin was when I was six and a half. My mom took me to two teachers, one for piano and one for violin. The piano teacher had me sit on the bench and repeatedly press the "A" key...over and over again as she droned on and on about the benefits of playing piano to my mother. Needless to say, I was extremely bored. However in the violin teacher's office, she had me hold the violin and scratch out a few notes. The teacher then played a piece for me, and I was immediately entranced. I had never heard an instrument so beautiful before. And with that, I knew the violin was the instrument for me.</p>

				<p class="img-description">Sophia started violin too</p>
				<p class="img-description2">(Because I was just too cool)</p>
				<p class="img-story">When I started playing the violin, my little sister Sophia must have been pretty impressed because she started begging my mom to play it too. When she finally turned six, she also started the violin, copying everything about me...from my clothing to my activities (in reality my mom just thought it was a good idea to dress us in the exact same thing...all the time...). We both started playing at the Blair school of music at Vanderbilt University, where my parents worked. There, I learned the wonders of group classes, orchestras, and play-in concerts. We would walk to Blair from school once a week, and stay there for our lessons, group classes, and orchestra rehearsals until 7 or 8 at night. Nothing much has changed except I'm at a different music school, Preucil, and I'm now there multiple times a week until somtimes 9 at night. I wouldn't change these memories for anything in the world because music is a part of who I am. It allowed me to express myself when my shy self struggled to use words to express my ideas to others. I've met so many friends through music; it brings people together.</p>

				<p class="img-description2">(with my current teacher Linda Judiesch)</p>
				<p class="img-story">When I moved to Iowa, I started a new path in music at the Preucil School of Music. I took two introductory lessons, one with Sonja and the other with Linda. I guess I must have liked Linda more because I'm on my 9th year with her. She saw my bad habits and flaws right away, regressing me two books prior. I continued group classes and orchestra, though I was the oldest kid in my group and the most behind for my age. That didn't stop me and I kept practicing and improving. One of my proudest memories is when I finally joined the violin group with peers my age, after two years of hard work. </p>

				<p class="img-description">Preucil Certificate Piano</p>
				<p class="img-description2">(I had wanted to play since 4th grade)</p>
				<p class="img-story">In 4th grade, one of my friends, Yuhka, played the piano. I thought she was so cool and so I wanted to play it too. When I went to my godparents' house that had a piano, I would sit down and play for hours, teaching myself from book one. It wasn't until junior year when my family bought a used piano and I started lessons on a scholarship as part of the Certificate music program at Preucil. Though I am not good at piano by any means and people kept telling me I was crazy for trying to pick up another instrument in the middle of high school, it made me happy. I love sitting down at the piano whenever I'm stressed or just feel like it. I hope to continue learning and playing more musical instruments in the future (especially the guitar).</p>
